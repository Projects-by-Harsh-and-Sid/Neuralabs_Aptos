      "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the capital of France and its significance. Since they mentioned being a geography enthusiast, they probably want more than just the basic answer. First, I need to confirm that Paris is indeed the capital. I remember that Paris has been the capital for a long time, but maybe I should check if there were any historical changes. For significance, I should think about its political, cultural, and economic roles. Politically, it's the seat of government, home to institutions like the Élysée Palace. Culturally, Paris is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame. It's a hub for art, fashion, and cuisine. Economically, it's a major center for business and finance. Also, historically significant events like the French Revolution took place there. I should mention its role in international affairs, hosting organizations like UNESCO. Maybe add some historical context about how it became the capital. I need to present this clearly and concisely, making sure the information is accurate and covers the key points a geography enthusiast would appreciate.\n",
